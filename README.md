Arduino and Processing Sketches for the ADXL345 Accelerometer

The Arduino sketch gives displays the sensor information and measuremtns in the serial monitor. It is possible to set the Range (2g/4g/8g/16g) in the Sketch. 

Works and tested with arduino 1.0.1


The Processing Sketch displays the accelerations in a visible graph for each of the 3 axis including the minima and maxima measures since the program start.

Works and tested with Processing 2.07
