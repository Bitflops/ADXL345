Arduino and Processing Sketches for the ADXL345 Accelerometer

The Arduino sketch outputs the sensor information and measurements to a serial terminal. The setting of the Sensor Range (2g/4g/8g/16g) can be done in the Sketch following the indications in the commented code. 

The Sketch is based on two libraries from Adafruit that you can get here:

Works and tested with Arduino 1.0.1


The Processing Sketch displays the accelerations in a visible graph for each of the 3 axis including the minima and maxima measures since the program start.

Works and tested with Processing 2.07
